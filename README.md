# DLib

The idea of this project is to provide automatic basic CRUD functionalities on SQL standarized lookup/dictionary tables.

# SQL assumptions

The lookup table has the following structure: (int ID = key auto increment NOT NULL, nvarchar value, bit is_active, date created_on, nvarchar created_by, date modified_on, nvarchar modified_by)

# Requirements

All of the required references should be already included in packages.conf and download automaticaly while building the project
